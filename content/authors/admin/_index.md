Victoire Spoerry founded Le Monde selon Victoire in 2013, a boutique travel advisor for fashion icons and business leaders. Le Monde selon Victoire became notorious for its unparalleled network among luxury hotels, making miracles for clients expecting ultimate attention to details.

Behind the scenes, her personal journey was marked by brutal health challenges. Her life was miraculously saved - a rebirth to tune in to serenity, to trust ancestral medicine, and to share insights and wisdom. As a give back, Victoire founded an intimate holistic retreat in Perigord, France, where guests from all over the world came to find healing peace, as well as occasionally, the meaning of (their) life.
