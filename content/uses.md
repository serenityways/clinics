The idea of a Uses page is to tell you about the method I use when it comes to health and wellness.

I often get asked about what healthy lifestyle practices I use, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious readers to when I get asked.

## Starting the day

- After sun salutations, I meditate while singing a mantra before breakfast

## Eating

- My diet is plant-based and gluten-free. It's what gives me the most energy throughout the day
- I drink rooibos tea in the morning, and then water the rest of the day
- I take the following supplements, daily: AFA Max and Naturastem

## Exercising

- I stick to a daily core workout routine (45 minutes)
- I try to swim or walk outside every day (45 minutes)

## Travelling

- The optimal travel rhythm for me is approximatively once per month: I try to keep a balance between getting inspired and being anchored
- I try to limit myself to 2 international travel conferences per year (sometimes 3).

## Medical wellness retreats

- I love to have a deep detox cure once a year. I can feel the regenerative benefits several months after
- As I am frequently asked to test and review health and wellness retreats, I try to keep a buffer of 2 months between intense programs
